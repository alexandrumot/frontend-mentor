## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Animations

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to use animations:


```css
@keyframes fadein {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to { opacity: 1; }
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue using animations in my future projects.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools CSS Animations](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp) - One of the best resources for CSS animations.
